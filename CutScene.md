# Opening CutScene

[Scene 1: Space]

Inside the spacecraft, Green and Blue engage in a conversation about advanced scientific matters.

Green: "The quantum flux readings from sector 7 are fascinating. It seems to correlate with our earlier hypothesis on subspace anomalies."

Blue: "Indeed. If we can collect more data, it might provide insights into the nature of interstellar phenomena."

Their conversation is abruptly interrupted by flashing lights and warning alarms.

Green: "Something's wrong. Our sensors are detecting a sudden surge in radiation levels."

Blue: "This is unexpected. We must notify the mothership immediately."

Green: "Agreed. I'll send the distress signal right away."

Green swiftly operates the communication console, sending out a distress signal to the mothership.
